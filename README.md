# JUnit-Testing-COEN-448-A1-

It was the first Assignment given to us for Software Testing and Validation where I had to use JUnit testing for specifically testing the Remove Method from three types of lists which are Array List, Double Linked List and Linked List.

Also Had to use BBC(Basic Choice Coverage) and ECC(Each choice Coverage) to complete the test.
